marfunky
========

A bunch of useful functions for the practising ecologist. Basically this is just a collection of individual functions I collected and wrote for my use over the years. 

The intention is to provide me with a handy package to load all these functions via library instead of loading them in the beginning.

Interested R-uses can load these functions as well. 
Just install the package 'devtools' and call
<pre>
  install_github("Curlew/marfunky","marfunky")
  library(marfunky)
</pre>
Have fun and enjoy!
