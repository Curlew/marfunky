========

A bunch of useful functions for the practising ecologist. Basically this is just a collection of individual functions, which I collected (scrambled) from the net or wrote for my own use in the last years. 

The intention of this package is to provide me with a handy way to load all several functions and scripts that I use in my daily coding using a single *library* call.

Interested R-uses can download and load this package as well. 
Just install the package 'devtools' and call
<pre>
  install_github("Curlew/marfunky","marfunky")
  library(marfunky)
</pre>
Have fun and enjoy!
